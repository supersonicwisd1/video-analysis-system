00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
What is artificial intelligence? Before
we answer that let's look at these terms

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.019
individually what do you understand by
the term artificial well it can be

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.030
anything that is made by humans things
that are not natural and what do you

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.820
understand by intelligence it is the
ability to understand think and learn so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.340
what do we get when we combine these two
together

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.740
artificial intelligence is a broad area
of computer science that makes machine

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.899
seem like they have human intelligence
the goal of AI is to mimic the human

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.670
brain and create systems that can
function intelligently and independently

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.090
they say that the age of AI is here but
then you might be wondering why don't

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
you see flying cars or robotic maids
bringing you lunch why doesn't your life

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.180
look more like the Jetsons
well for starters that's a cartoon and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.680
when it comes to AI a robot is nothing
more than a shell concealing what's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.960
actually used to power the technology AI
can manifest itself in many different

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.210
ways if you have ever asked Alexa to
order your food or browse Netflix movie

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.549
suggestions you are actually interacting
with AI without realizing it and that's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.500
kind of the point a is designed so you
do not realize that there is a machine

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.390
calling the shots in the near future
ai is expected to become a little less

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.479
artificial and a lot more intelligent as
AI becomes more intelligent it will

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.320
obviously take on the role of an
intelligent worker while most of the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.200
repetitive and largely time oriented
tasks can be automated using AI we will

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
still need human experts who can build
and maintain these synthetic BOTS and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.060
work on the strategic and creative
aspects of a job

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.750
so in conclusion AI is a boon that can
help optimize any job this means that as

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.729
always it's not AI versus humans rather
it is a combination of humans and AI

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.140
versus the actual problem statement so
what are you waiting for

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.810
pull up your socks and get ready to be a
part of this AI revolution start

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.810
learning this trending technology using

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.770
