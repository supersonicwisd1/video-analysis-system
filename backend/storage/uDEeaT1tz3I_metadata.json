At the top, there's text in bold black saying, \"ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOF (ZKP) CAN PROVE A FACT WITHOUT LEAKING ANY PRIVACY INFORMATION.\"\n\nBelow this text, there are two phrases. On the left, \"EMERGENCE OF ZKP\" is written in blue. On the right, \"PROTECT PRIVACY DATA\" is depicted in orange. Between these phrases, there is a blue arrow pointing from left to right, suggesting a progression or transition.\n\nBelow these elements, there is a visual representation of a hand in blue, palm facing up, holding a lock. The lock is black, with a blue keyhole in the center, symbolizing security and privacy.\n\nThe overall layout is minimalistic with a white background, emphasizing clarity and focus on the message conveyed about ZKPs and privacy.",

There is a hand holding a black marker, actively writing on the screen, contributing to the presentation format. \n\nText in the image is black and blue:\n\n1. At the top, in bold black uppercase letters, is the title: \"ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOF USE CASES.\"\n\n2. Below the title, there is a bullet point written in blue that reads: \"\u2013 PROVE A STUDENT HAVE PASSED THE EXAM WITHOUT SHOWING THE ACTUAL MARK.\"\n\n3. A second bullet point is being written. The hand with the marker is starting to write the word beginning with \"W\" in orange.\n\nThe setting of the frame gives the impression of a tutorial or informational video, utilizing a hand-drawn style to explain or list concepts related to \"Zero Knowledge Proof\" use cases. The use of color differentiates the main points (blue text) from the introductory title (black text) and emphasizes the action of writing (orange text).",
